# Spring Boot CRUD Application with Vue.js

## Description
This is a simple Spring Boot CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a Vue.js frontend. It demonstrates how to build a web-based application for managing data using Spring Boot as the backend and Vue.js as the frontend. The application includes common CRUD operations and serves as an example of integrating Vue.js with Spring Boot.

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- A clean and well-organized project structure, with the backend in Spring Boot and the frontend in Vue.js.
- Integration with a MySQL database for data storage.
- RESTful API endpoints for data manipulation on the backend.
- A Vue.js frontend with components for interacting with the backend.
- Easy-to-use and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven build tool
- MySQL database server
- Node.js and npm (for Vue.js)
- Git (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
2. Configure the backend: Create a MySQL database and update the database configuration in src/main/resources/application.properties with your database credentials.
3. Configure the frontend: Navigate to the frontend directory and install the Vue.js dependencies.

## Usage
Use the Vue.js frontend to interact with the application and perform CRUD operations on the data.
The Vue.js frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend via RESTful API endpoints.
